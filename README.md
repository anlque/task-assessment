# Question Punk Exercise

Take a look at my paramsReducer and ParamsContext, I made them to show you I can manage reducers and context, 
in real life I would rather keep posts data in context, but there is no need for that in this small test task.
Also would be great if you check on my hook useDebounce, which I use for search requests.

I was trying to do all my best in showing usage of different tools, so please do not make fast decisions, 
I hope you will ask me first about this code, for me to specify the reasons of using some tools.
